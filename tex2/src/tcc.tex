\section{Homological Sensor Networks and the TCC} % (fold)
\label{sec:tcc}

Throughout we have been using the Rips complex as a discrete representation of our coverage domain by assuming the sensor coverage radius is equal to the communication radius.
In fact, if the Rips complex of a sensor network at scale $\alpha$ has no gaps, then the minimum coverage radius required is a constant factor smaller than $\alpha$.
This point is made clear by an interleaving of the Rips with another simplicial complex known as the \v Cech complex.

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{\v Cech complex} of a finite collection of points $P$ at scale $\e > 0$ is defined
    \[ \cech^\e(P) := \left\{\sigma \subseteq P\mid \bigcap_{p\in \sigma}\ball_\e(p)\neq \emptyset \right\}. \]
\end{definition}
The \v Cech complex is a special case of a more general construction known as the \textbf{nerve} $\N(\U)$ of a collection of sets $\U = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}$, where $I$ is any indexing set.
The nerve of $\U$ is defined as the simplicial complex with vertex set $I$ such that $\sigma\subseteq I$ is a simplex if and only if
\[
  \bigcap_{i\in \sigma} U_i\neq \emptyset.
\]
The collection $\U$ is a \textbf{good cover} if for each $\sigma\subset I$ the set $\bigcap_{i\in\sigma} U_i$ is contractible or empty.
The \textbf{Nerve Lemma} states that if $\U$ is a good cover then its nerve $\N(\U)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$.
That is, for a set of nodes $P\subset\D$ such that $\U = \{\ball_\e(p)\mid p\in P\}$ is a good cover the nerve $\N(\U)$ is homotopy equivalent to $P^\e = \bigcup_{p\in P} \ball_\e(p)$.
It follows that the \v Cech complex $\cech_\e(P)$ of $P$ at scale $\e$ is a suitable representation of the coverage region $P^\e$.

In order to construct the \v Cech complex our sensors must be able to measure not only the proximity of neighboring nodes, but the precise distance between them.
Fortunately, the \v Cech and Rips complexes of a finite metric space are closely related by a result that follows from Jung's Theorem~\cite{jung01uber} relating the diameter of a point set $P$ and the radius of the minimum enclosing ball:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jung_inclusion}
  \cech^\e(P)\subseteq\rips^\e(P)\subseteq\cech^{\jungd \e}(P)\subseteq\rips^{\jungd\e}(P),
\end{equation}
where the constant $\jungd = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{d+1}}$ (see~\cite{buchet15efficient}).

Equipped with this interleaving we are now ready to define all conditions necessary for verifying coverage in a coordinate-free sensor network.
Specifically, we will introduce a second radius of communication $\beta\geq 3\alpha$ that will allow us to lower $\alpha$, which will remain our coverage radius, so that homomorphism on (relative) homology induced by the inclusion of Rips complexes $\rips^\alpha(P)\to\rips^\beta(P)$ reflects that of the \v Cech complex, and therefore the coverage domain.

\subsection{The Topological Coverage Criterion}

To recap, we have an unknown, bounded domain $\D$ with boundary $\B$ and a finite collection of sample points $P\subset\D$.
Each sensor, represented by a single point $p\in P$, can do the following:

\vspace{3ex}
\begin{center}
\setlength{\fboxsep}{2ex}
\fbox{\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a.]\textbf{(Communication Radii)} detect the presence, but not location or distance, of sensors within distances $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta \geq 3\alpha$, and discriminate between sensors within each scale,
        \item[b.]\textbf{(Coverage Radius)} cover a radially symmetric subset of the domain with radius $\alpha$,
        \item[c.]\textbf{(Boundary Detection)} detect the presence of the boundary $\B$ within distance $\alpha$.
    \end{itemize}
}}\end{center}\vspace{3ex}

\begin{definition}
    For a pair of sets $(\D, \B)$ such that $\B\subseteq \D$, we say that $\B$ \emph{surrounds} $\D$ if there is no path from $\D\setminus\B$ to $\comp{\D}$ that does not intersect $\B$.
    Formally, $\B$ surrounds $\D$ if and only if $H_0(\D\setminus \B) \cong H_0(\comp{\B}, \comp{\D})$, where $\comp{\D}$ denotes the complement of $\D$ in the ambient space containing $\D$.
\end{definition}

If such a pair satisfies the following conditions for $0 < 3\alpha\leq \beta$, we want to certify that a finite sample $P\subset\D$ covers $\D$ at scale $\alpha$ in the sense that $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}\subset P^\alpha$.
\euclidean{Although the TCC holds for more general spaces with a few technical assumptions (see~\cite{cavanna17when}) we will assume that our domain $\D$ is a subset of $\R^d$ for the sake of simplicity.}

\textbf{Geometric Assumptions}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
        \item \textbf{(The Domain)} \noeuclidean{$\D$ is a bounded, compact length space homeomorphic to a subset of $\R^d$}\euclidean{$\D$ is a bounded, compact subset of $\R^d$} and $\B\subseteq \D$ is closed and surrounds $\D$.

}}\end{center}\vspace{4ex}

% Lemma~\ref{lem:shrunken_to_relative} allows us talk about the homology of a subset of the domain $\D\setminus\B^\e$ in terms of relative homology.
% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:shrunken_to_relative}
%     If $\B$ surrounds $\D$, then for all $\e>0$, $\hom_0((\D\setminus\B^{\e},\emptyset)\hookrightarrow (\comp{\B^{\e}},\comp{\D^{\e}}))$ is an isomorphism.

\end{wrapfigure}

Assumption~1 disallows domains with components that are too small to be included in the map from $\D\setminus\B^{\alpha+\beta}\hookrightarrow\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}$ so we can reliably compare the coverage region to the sampled subset of the domain in terms of the $0$-dimensional homology, or connected components.
Fig.~\ref{fig:assumption1} illustrates a domain in which the induced map is not surjective.

Assumption $2$ requires that the components of $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}$ are spaced out well enough so that no components are joined with inclusion into $\D^{2\alpha}$.
This includes regions of a connected component of $\D$ that are ``pinched'' into two in $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}$ as well as pairs of components in $\D$ that are too close.
Both are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:assumption2}.
% Fig.~\ref{fig:assumption2} illustrates domains which violate Assumption $2$.

\end{figure}

Assumptions 0-2 are necessary in order to prove the Geometric TCC (see~\cite{cavanna17when}) and, in particular, Assumption $2$ is necessary for the Algorithmic TCC (Theorem~\ref{thm:algorithmic_tcc}) in order to bound the number of connected components of the shrunken domain $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}$.

\subsubsection{Algorithmic TCC}

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ a \textbf{clique} is a collection of vertices $\sigma\subseteq V$ such that $\{u,v\}\in E$ for all $u,v\in\sigma$.
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{clique complex} of $G$ is defined to be a simplicial complex with simplices for each clique in $G$.
    \[ \clique(G) := \{ \sigma\subseteq V\mid \forall u,v\in\sigma, \{u,v\}\in E \}. \]

    Given a pair of graphs $(G, H)$ where $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, we will denote the pair of Clique complexes as $\clique(G,H) = (\clique(G),\clique(H))$.
\end{definition}

Let $(\D,\B)$ be a pair of spaces satisfying Assumptions $0$--$2$ for constants $\alpha > 0$, $\beta\geq 3\alpha$.
The input to Algorithm~\ref{alg:rips_certify_coverage} will be a pair of graphs $(G_1, G_2)$, a finite weighted point sample $P\subset \D$ and a subsample $Q=\{p\in P\mid \ball_\alpha(p)\cap\B \neq \emptyset\}$.

\textbf{Input Assumptions}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{+2}
        \item The graphs $G_1, G_2$ have a vertex set $P\subset\D$ and subgraphs $G_1[Q], G_2[Q]$ induced by restriction to the vertex set

    \end{enumerate}
}}\end{center}\vspace{3ex}

The input graphs will be used to construct clique complexes, which by Assumption $5$ can be interleaved with \v Cech complexes at scale $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
% \euclidean{The input graphs will be used to construct Rips complexes which can be interleaved with \v Cech complexes by equation~\ref{eq:jung_inclusion}.}
\noeuclidean{Assumption $4$ allows us to apply the Persistent Nerve Lemma~\cite{chazal08towards}.
Note that Assumption $5$ is satisfied when every clique $\sigma\subseteq G_1$ satisfies $\bigcap_{v\in\sigma} \ball_\alpha(v)\neq \emptyset$ and $\ball_\beta(u)\cap\ball_\beta(v)\neq\emptyset$ implies $\{u,v\}\in E(G_2)$ for all $u, v\in\sigma$.
When the domain $\D$ is equipped with the Euclidean metric, Assumption $5$ is equivalent to the interleaving provided by Jung's theorem (Equation~\ref{eq:jung_inclusion}) where the \kcoverage{$k$-clique complex of $G_1$ can be taken as the $k$-Rips}\nokcoverage{clique complex of $G_1$ can be taken as the Rips} complex of $P$ at scale $\alpha/\jungd$.}
\euclidean{Note that because we have assumed our domain $\D$ is equipped with the Euclidean metric Assumption $4$ is equivalent to the interleaving provided by Jung's theorem (Equation~\ref{eq:jung_inclusion}) where the \kcoverage{$k$-clique complex of $G_1$ can be taken as the $k$-Rips}\nokcoverage{clique complex of $G_1$ can be taken as the Rips} complex of $P$ at scale $\alpha/\jungd$.}
\noeuclidean{Finally, }Assumption \noeuclidean{6}\euclidean{5} is required to prove a bound on the number of connected components of $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}$ using a computable combinatorial structure.

% \begin{theorem}[Geometric TCC]\label{thm:geometric_tcc}
%   Given a compact, locally contractible domain $\D\subset\R^d$ with boundary $\B\subset\D$, a sample $P\subset\D$, $Q = \B^\alpha\cap P$ and $i_*:\hom_0(\comp{Q^{\beta}},\comp{P^{\beta}})\to\hom_0(\comp{Q^{\alpha}},\comp{P^{\alpha}})$ where $0\leq\alpha\leq\beta$, if $j_*: \hom_0(\comp{\B^{\alpha+\beta}},\comp{\D^{\alpha+\beta}})\to \hom_0(\comp{\B^{2\alpha}},\comp{\D^{2\alpha}})$ is surjective and $\rank~i_* \ge \rank~j_*$ then $\D_{2\alpha}\subseteq P^\alpha$.
% \end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Algorithmic TCC]\label{thm:algorithmic_tcc}
    Consider a pair $(\D,\B)$, a finite point sample $P\subset\D$, and constants $\kcoverage{k,}\alpha,\beta$, where $0 < 3\alpha\leq \beta$, satisfying Assumptions $0$--$\euclidean{5}\noeuclidean{7}$.

    If
    \kcoverage{\[\rank~\hom_d(\clique_k(G_1, G_1[Q])\hookrightarrow \clique_k(G_2, G_2[Q])) =|\textrm{Components}(G_1[P\setminus Q])|\]}
    \nokcoverage{\[\rank~\hom_d(\clique(G_1, G_1[Q])\hookrightarrow \clique(G_2, G_2[Q])) =|\textrm{Components}(G_1[P\setminus Q])|\]}
    then $\D\setminus\B^{2\alpha}\subseteq \kcoverage{P_k^\alpha}\nokcoverage{P^\alpha}$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Implementation}

We have included an implementation of the TCC which implements Algorithm~\ref{alg:rips_certify_coverage} for exploratory purposes.

    		\EndProcedure
    	\end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

A domain $\D\subset\R^2$ is generated by a Gaussian random field as a function on the plane by identifying a sublevel set and the surrounding region $\B$ that satisfies our geometric assumptions.

            (Right) The distance to a sublevel set of the function identified as our domain $\D$ with boundary $\B$ in black.}
    \label{fig:hsn}
\end{figure}

We then sample the domain with a collection of points $P\subset\D$ and select a subset $Q$ of $P$ within a fixed distance $\alpha$ of $\B$.
The Dionysus C++ library~\cite{dionysus2} is used to construct the 3-dimensional rips complex of $P$ at scale $\beta = 3\alpha$ in addition to the persistent relative homology of the pair $(\rips^\beta(P), \rips^\beta(Q))$.
The rank of the inclusion \[H_2(\rips^\alpha(P), \rips^\alpha(Q))\to H_2(\rips^\beta(P), \rips^\beta(Q))\] is identified as the number of features in $\dgm_2(\rips^\beta(P), \rips^\beta(P))$ which have not died at scale $\beta$, but were born at scale at most $\alpha$.
This is then compared to the number of connected components in $\rips^\alpha(P\setminus Q)$ as the number of features in $\dgm_0(\rips^\alpha(P\setminus Q))$ that have not died at scale $\alpha$.

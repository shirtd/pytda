[1.0]
3rd  paragraph before coverage def
4th paragraph, no recall, we now have a simplicial complex.
5th paragraph define a pair, mention homology
end with an overview of all sections

intro: define simplicial complexes, motivate hsn setup

sec 1: homology intuition
	relative homology
sec 1.1: functions on simplicial complexes
	functional persistence
sec 1.2: metric persistence
sec 1.3: tcc setup

sec 2: cohomology
sec 2.1: cochains
sec 2.2: circular coordinates
	functions on simplicial complexes
sec 2.3: dec setup

sec 3: tcc definition
sec 3.1: implementation

sec 4: dec application
sec 4.1: without coverage
sec 4.2: with coverage

generalize nodes in a sensor network to unknowns
with a measure, define/confirm coverage
observe a function on network

how can we "fit" a bounded domain to a function
 -> fit harmonic cocycles to harmonics of the function
